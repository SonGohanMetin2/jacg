Repository for the Java Attack Calculus Gear (Metin2 attack calculation tool)

The Java Attack Calculus Gear is the latest-generation tool for Attack and Damage calculation in Metin2.
It was created by Son Gohan in 2013 and exploits a bunch of game formulas discovered by Son Gohan, Mystikal
(former wiki.metin2.it staff) and some other Italian Metin2 players, particularly AlbyElite.

Installing
----------------
You just need to have Java SE7 or later; the JAR file is the standalone package containing the tool and
the weapon database. To use it, just double-click on jacg.jar, or type in the terminal:

java -jar /path/to/jacg.jar

Updating or editing the weapon database
-----------------------------------------
The weapon database is a simple text file contained in the JAR package. If you want to edit it, just
extract it from the archive with:

jar xvf jacg.jar it/metin2/wiki/weapondb.txt

(you must be in the same directory as jacg.jar). Once edited, re-archive it with

jar cvf jacg.jar it/metin2/wiki/weapondb.txt.

(the file weapondb.txt must be in the directory it/metin2/wiki/ relative to jacg.jar).

The database contains a table in the format:

NAME ATK_MIN[0-9] ATK_MAX[0-9] DIFFERENCE_ATK(MAX-MIN) ATK_SPEED ATK_GROWTH WEAPON_TYPE

where:
* ATK_MIN, ATK_MAX, ATK_SPEED and ATK_GROWTH consist of 10 columns with the values at each up;
* ATK_GROWTH at up X is defined as ATK_MAX(up=X) - ATK_MIN(up=X);
* TYPE is one of these:
1) SPADONE (2-handed sword)
2) SPADA (1-handed sword)
3) SPADA_SURA (1-handed sword only for SURA)
4) PUGNALE (dagger)
5) ARCO (bow)
6) CAMPANA (bell)
7) VENTAGLIO (fan)
